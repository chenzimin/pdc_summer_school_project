Test files description
-----------------------

	Remind that you can execute the program with multiple interleaved
	repetitions of the same wave files to generate the desired workload.

test_01
	Basic general debugging test, for small arrays of 35 positions. 

test_02
	Small workload test, for arrays of 30.000 positions. 
	Each wave has 20.000 random particles.

test_03 to test_06	
	Test race conditions and proper communication in borders of partitions. 
	Execute with arrays of 20 positions, with 2 and 4 threads/processes,
	only one file at a time.

test_07
	Optimizations test, for arrays of 1 million positions. 
	Each wave has 5.000 random particles.

test_08
	Reduction efficiency test, for arrays with 100 million positions, 
	only 1 particle per wave.

test_09
	Execute with both 16 and 17 array positions to see the difference. 
	Use it to test that the behaviour of the sequential program in 
	the array extremes has been preserved after your transformations.
